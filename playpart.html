        <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b><br>Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them, certainly; butâ€”<p style="color: red;">(petra comes in from the sitting-room).</p> Back from school already?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Yes. I have been given notice of dismissal.</p>  
        <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b><br>Dismissal?</p>  
        <p><b>Dr. Stockmann.</b><br>You too?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Mrs. Busk gave me my notice; so I thought it was best to go at once.</p>
        <p><b>Dr. Stockmann.</b><br>You were perfectly right, too!</p>
        <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b><br>Who would have thought Mrs. Busk was a woman like that!</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Mrs. Busk isn't a bit like that, mother; I saw quite plainly how it hurt her to do it. But she didn't dare do otherwise, she said; and so I got my notice.</p>
        <p><b>Dr. Stockmann.</b><br><p style="color: red;">(laughing and rubbing his hands).</p>She didn't dare do otherwise, either! It's delicious!</p>
