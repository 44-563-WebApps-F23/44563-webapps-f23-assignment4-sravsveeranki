        <p><b>Mrs.Stockmann.</b><br>Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them, certainly; butâ€” [petra comes in from the sitting-room].Back from school already?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Yes. I have been given notice of dismissal.</p>
        <p><b>Mrs.Stockmann.</b><br>Dismissal?</p>
        <p><b>Dr.Stockmann.</b><br>You too?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Mrs. Busk gave me my notice; so I thought it was best to go at once.</p>
        <p><b>Dr.Stockmann.</b><br>You were perfectly right, too!</p>
        <p><b>Mrs.Stockmann.</b><br>Who would have thought Mrs. Busk was a woman like that!</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b><br>Mrs. Busk isn't a bit like that, mother; I saw quite plainly how it hurt her to do it. But she didn't dare do otherwise, she said; and so I got my notice.</p>
        <p><b>Dr.Stockmann.</b><br>[laughing and rubbing his hands].She didn't dare do otherwise, either! It's delicious!</p>
        <p><b>Mrs.Stockmann.</b><br>Well, after the dreadful scenes last night</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b>It was not only that. Just listen to this, father!</p>
        <p><b>Dr.Stockmann.</b>Well?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b>Mrs. Busk showed me no less than three letters she received this morning</p>
        <p><b>Dr.Stockmann.</b>Anonymous, I suppose?</p>
        <p><b>Petra.</b>Yes.</p>
